# VRGrid demo

VRGrid is implemented using closed source (at least for the moment) framework.
The main code is located in the `src` folder, and the main algorithm loop is the `arrangeIter` function.
A compiled version of VRGrid is available in the `executable` folder **but will probably not run on your machine since several libraries are required**.
I will provide a cleaner version of the demo soon enough.

The complete code should be available on the `wulip` repo maintained at LaBRI. Please ask my thesis supervisor for full access.
